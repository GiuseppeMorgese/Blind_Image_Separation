# Blind_Image_Separation
The purpose of the project is to separate an image obtained as a sum of two images into its single components.
The two images img1 and img2 summed together come from two different datasets: MNIST and FASHION_MNIST, respectively.
No preprocessing was allowed. The network takes as input the sum and returns the predicted components.
